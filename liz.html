   <p style="color: white"> 1. June telltales on how a fairy blooms, it says something about a girl sleeping in a midnight story of tranquility. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 2. Your love was home, for lack of a lesser-used word, but it'll always remain as the splendid one — instant familiarity under the unconditional acceptance. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 3. You know how to love to the only extent that you can and though I don't know much, it stays lasting and constant. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 4.And so in that field of sour grapes and earthing flowers, you are cherry-picked, so sweet despite the tiny rot that bloomed inside. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 5.Your arms didn't feel like a war, but rather it's an excruciating peace that brings me to the cozy dims of the clouds. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 6.The traces of your lips were like the road in atlantic, your eyes were in hues of jet black without the presence of the light looking like a billow with a whirlpool of words behind her keen pupils. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 7.You tuck the strands of your hair behind the tiny pinkish ears and no matter how many times I get to witness that, I call the heavens for thankfulness. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 8.You're someone's daughter building a soul full of life in living ordinarily but thinking to be worthless—but I see you in the glamorous light of pyramids and pearls you've never seen before. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 9.You would carry a tiny lump of my soul that feels sinking into the waves right underneath my skin—entangled by your beauty. 
   <p style="color: white"> 10.Your skin remains delicate and fiery to touch, with the pupils of the eyes that can see what's beyond the stars— and heaven knows I am too weak to witness how your hair dances in midnight wind. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 11.We were both young and frail, but you remind me of wildfires and blue oceans. And all the goodness in me is reduced by this clenched fist, all to protect your tiny wings. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 12.You look so mellow that I can't even break a bone, let alone ruin everyone's life. See, you're born with feathers that can easily bend, and with that, I became a slave of your tenderness. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 13.You're a bambino sprouting on a mother's blooming greenery. You grew on parched soils in a divine garden, a flower child of mine. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 14.Beauty overflows in you as comprised of pollens and grace but you wither and still dances on the youth of your dreamy skin.</p>
   <p style="color: white"> 15.You, like a light year with thousands sheltered constellations — persist in darkness and seek comfort in lullabies when a star's inception embracing me to sleep. (but also the cause of my nightly insomnia lol) </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 16. When we are left between nothing but sighs,may your storms rest underneath my skin. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 17. You are another dahlia pressed against a book, blooming as autumn continues to welcome your shiny smiles. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> 18. I will remember you like the ocean waves — going back and forth, a pendulum, an ethereal dream I will keep forever. </p>
   <p style="color: white"> You remind me of Kanagawa waves, of the solemn sea yearning for the sands of nostalgia. And if love won't conquer, then we will. </p>
